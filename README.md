# Employee-Tracker-HW12

## Description

The goal was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems.

The app involved building a command-line application that allows the user to:

. View departments, roles, employees
. Add departments, roles, employees
. Update employee roles
. Update employee managers
. Delete departments, roles, and employees
